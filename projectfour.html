				<p>One Hour A Day is a social platform that aims to diversify contributors to development projects. Project owners post various products and tasks that need to be completed and volunteers are able to browse and complete these tasks based on their skill level. The tasks are supposed to be small easily managed chunks that can be completed in a few hours. My capacity on this project is UX Designer and Front-End Development. Out of the two functions I primarly focus on UX design and wireframe work for the various versions of the platform. Currently we are working on web, android, and iOS versions with an expected release date of late 2018.</p>

				<p>I have thoroughly enjoyed my time on this project as it has taught me many aspects of working within a team to accomplish a design goal. I have been able to learn about various programs and collaborating platforms that help streamline both my own workflow as well as the teams. In this project I have the responsibility of being the lead designer for the group. This function has taught me to really really work on time management and communication. In order to keep things running smoothly, I have develop a system to allow contributors to claim their own tasks while simoultaneously requesting various designers to attack certain problems. We have been pretty successful so far and can easily track both the progress of the project and the commitment level of our contributing designers. This has also been a unique experience for me as I have taken on mostly a design role instead of development which has allowed me to talk with our developers about the designs and how I can improve my wireframes to allow developers to understand them better.</p>

				<p>The above two pictures demonstrated a unique challenge for our design team as there is a large amount of content to be presented in not a lot of space. As such it was important we got all of the elements on the screen without making it appear too junky. As you can see our quality control at the time of this design is a bit slacking and that is something that I have been taking up mostly and in future process will designate accordingly.</p>

				<p>This picture depicts our development concept where components will be coded in a step by step bases in order to keep the process simple as well as keep with our concept of the project as a whole. I was personally challenged by this mock-up as it forced me to really think through each element and how I percieved the difficulty of each component. I attempted to break up the page in enough parts to create a self-explanatory development flow while still allowing enough cohesion to create a functioning website during its development. I've enjoyed my time on this project and look forward to continuing working and improving the group workflow and final product.</p>
