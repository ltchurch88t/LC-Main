				<p>The creation of this website was primarily to allow myself the online presence to display work I am proud of. The design behind this site was focused on creating a simple, flowing, and lightweight experience that accurately describes my talents as a web developer. The color scheme behind this site was inspired by the classic joker from Batman as I can't help but throw in a few comic book references whenever I can. I won't go into super crazy detail regarding screenshots and images from the site as you are more than welcome to peruse the pages and get a full experience of the design and concept behind this page.</p>

				<p>My primary challenge during the design and development process of this website was creating an original design with just the right amount of interesting. A huge pet peeve of mine is when websites become tacky. Whether that's too much animation, or a gimicky widget here and there, it just drives me wild! With this site I wanted to avoid some things I have seen other developers include in portfolio websites and chose to provide just the right mix of elements to content. This is purely my opinion! Throughout the design of the site I put a larger focus on the development of the mobile experience as many users typically view sites from their mobile phones instead of computer screens. As such I believe it to be of utmost importance to provide the best possible user experience on all screen sizes, big and small. With this in mind I chose to include only select animations to not clutter up the mobile experience while simoultaneously providing a rich experience on desktop as well. Please explore the site and try it out on your phone as well!</p>

				<p>The above two images are some examples of the design portion of my workflow before attempting to code anything. The little cartoon man iis a pretty good representation of myself, briefcase included! I enjoy drawing and creating various aspects for my websites not only because it avoids copyright issues but it drastically improves y efficiency. It also allows me to get exactly what I want and not be limited to the various designs on the internet. The second image of the graph is a sketch file to demonstrate how I typically create mock-ups of elements in order to efficiently produce the needed results in HTML and CSS. This image served as my developmet inspiration when I began coding. Ultimately, the result turned out exactly as I wanted and I was also able to add in some animation to enhance the overall effect.</p>
