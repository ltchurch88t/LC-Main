				<p>I was introduced by Mr. Crone through a mutual friend where we began discussing the importance of a strong web presence for any business. He professed to me that Crone Construction's website was riddled with issues and ultimately needed to be redone. After offering my services, Mr. Crone and I sat down later that week for dinner in order to discuss the overall needs of the project. The most important aspects of this site included: the initial landing page, easy navigation, and the ability to initiate immediate contact. Armed with these three ideas in mind we discussed various elements of the site including colors, layout, images, and corresponding verbiage. After concluding our dinner I began to work though the design of the site.</p>

				<p>My typical development workflow involves market research, mock-up designs, and then reuniting with the client in order to address concerns, ideas, and general vibes about the concept. I began the research phase for this website by scanning the construction market in the Memphis area to gauge the "competition" as it were. From there, I began to locate various stock media as well as Mr. Crone's provided material to enhance the overall appearance and visual engagement of the site. At this point during the project, I had felt comfortable enough with the design to move on to the mock-up phase where I begin to draw up wireframes of the site and collect various ideas to incorporate into the final product. I have always been a fan of creating physical adaptations of the digital world and as such I created a concept booklet representing various aspects of the design (much like design boards in other creative professions). I typically do this for larger projects as navigating a web page closely resembles flipping through a book or magazine and as such if the flow of my design book is not consistent or appealing, it is back to the drawing board. With booklet in hand, Mr. Crone and I sat down once more to go over the concepts and designs I had provided as well as make the necessary changes before moving on to the development stage.</p>

				<p>Sample version of the various pages. This is the about us section giving a brief history and framework for Crone Construction.</p>

			<div class="info-box-three">
				<p>The majority of the site is coded with HTML, CSS and PHP. The site itself has many dynamic pieces to it including several external widgets. The shell of the site comes from the previous template model used by Crone Construction on the previous site as it made it possible for me to reuse various code snippets. This also allowed me to keep certain verbiage, colors, and a few images within the same concept instead of having to start completely from scratch (although a majority needed to be changed...). Needing to integrate these various pieces provided me with a unique challenge that I had not been previously given, especailly on a commercial level. I began programming by blocking out the essential pieces and containers for the site while trying to account for necessary components that would be implemented later. A key improvement to my workflow that I developed as a result of this project, included partitioning the page elements into necessary components that can be programmed independently much like that of ReactJS, however, still within the realm of standard HTML and CSS. By approaching this site with this particular mindset I was able to repidly produce elements in a manner that had previously been unattainable. This process drastically improved my time to completion as well as forced me to think differently about my programming practices. This was alost my first attempt at developing for WordPress, which presented its own unique challenges.</p>

				<p>Another challenge I was faced with in this project, was the creation of a blog and integrated contact widgert. Being a primarily front-end developer and designer I do not spend a large amount of time on back-end and server related tasks, however, in this instance I challenged myself to learn the necessary components to make my clients vision come to fruition (the WordPress aspect also made this inevitable). Having a background in SQL allowed me to smoothly transition the data required for the blog and contact widget into my client's hosting service. As a result, I was able to integrate the contact form into an api service used by my client in order to create a seamless connection process that yields a much better client turn-around for Crone Construction. Also having the ability to blog about various aspects of the company has allowed Mr. Crone the ability to connect to his clients in a more meaningful way and at a much higher rate than before.</p>

				<p>The overall goal of this project was to create a modern, professional, and visually appealing commercial website to increase customer retention for Crone Construction. Looking back on the project I believe we accomplished all of these tasks both to my satisfaction as well as to Mr. Crone's. The project allowed me to expand my PHP knowledge as well as develop a steadier workflow during the development stage to allow for easier client access to material as it is being coded. I was also quite excited to attempt a WordPress site for the first time as this allowed me to exapnd my development horizons and attempt a larger portion of back-end development which I do not touch very often.</p>

				<p>Flyer designed for Crone Construction as a part of the company's initial meeting portfolio.</p>
			</div>
            <div class="info-box-four">
				<p>After completing the website, I was also asked to do some print media work including the above brochure. The concept behind the flyer was to create a single page document that could be given to a client on an initial meeting. Essentially, a folder stuffer that could present much of the info on the website in a short and concise document. This gave me a chance to take many of my design and development skills from the computer down to the physical realm. My main objective on this project was to create a seamless transition from the front page to the back while simoultaneously tying in elements of the company's logo. Overall I was pleased with the end result and enjoyed the diversion from the digital world for a brief stint.</p>
