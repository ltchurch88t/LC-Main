				<p>Well we all start somewhere. This was my first ever website that I created in any capacity. I was tasked with applying my freshly learned programming skills towards creating a simple yet functional academic site for my wife(quite the tough customer really...). During this trial run, I was able to discover some not so well thought out aspects of my design and development workflow. I thought I could sit at the computer and start hacking away at the keys whilst outputting a beautifully formatted webpage, boy was I wrong. Ultimately, I learned a valuable lesson that day, research and design before code. </p>

				<p>Simple homepage. First website ever....Essentially keep everything simple, functioning, and responsive.</p>

				<p>After miserablly failing during my first attempt, I decided to reevaluate my design strategy. First of which involved discussing with Anna what items were absolutely necessary in order for the site to function properly. At this point I began making notes to myself as to what elements needed to be prioritized over others in order to not only achieve the vision that Anna had, but also to craft a navigable web page. This discussion led to various notes regarding what content needed displayed, images to be placed, and general color scheme ideas.
				</p>
				<p>Freshly equipped with this information, I got to work right away. This project remained relatively simple throughout the majority of the process. All of the coding was completed using simple HTML and CSS(became best friends with grid!) making the release date within a couple days of beginning the project. After finishing the general layout and content uploading, I again sat with Anna to discuss further changes and for general feelings about the entire project. In all honesty, the first few attempts where scratched, primarily due to color schemes, however, after a sit-down session with Anna we were able to decide on a color pallete that reflects her individuality and is visually appealing.</p>

				<p>Use of CSS grid to create layout and the use of a visually appealing color scheme to tie it all off.</p>

				<p>The most challenging and new part to this project involved the use of CSS grid for a responsive design. This being my first time using grid, I would have to say that I was indeed nervous on how the process would go. Luckily the internet is your friend and that day I poured over literature and emerged a responsive web master. Media qeuries became my partner in crime and the final product looked great on screen size after screen size.</p>

				<p>Ultimately, the project itself was very simple and provided the opportunity to put my skills into action without the pressure of an outside client. So you may ask, why is this particular project relevant then? Well, you can't forget your roots and this guy was my first triumph. Also it's good advertising for my wife's website! Please feel free to visit!
